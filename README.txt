Introduction:
	EasyCalc is a command line-facing calculator utility application.
	It currently supports arithmetic, variable storing, and function definition.
	Future features may include basic calculus (integration, differentiation),
	and support for matrices with standard matrix operations.

Syntax:
	To evaluate an expression, simply type the expression and hit enter.
	Typing "let" before a variable assignment (e.g. "let x=2") will store
	the RHS value into the variables.
	Similarly, typing "let" before a function definition (e.g. "let f(x,y)=x+3*y")
	will allow that function to be called later (e.g. "3+f(1,2)").
